This site was imported from an Eleventy site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the writing, its settings and its addresses came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/eleventy-permalinks/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. The templates, snippets and stylesheet are Statac's starter, as `statac new` writes it: see https://statac.dev/new/.

## What came across

- 7 posts, into `content/posts/`.
- 1 draft, with `draft: true`, so it isn't published by accident.

The old site had no home page of its own writing, so the starter's home page stays, listing the posts: `content/index.md`.

Eleventy's settings are a program, and Statac runs none of it: it read `.eleventy.js` as text, for the plain forms it knows, and says here what it took and what it assumed where it found none.

Eleventy's settings hold no title, address or language for the site, so the new site's `title` is made from the old folder's name, it has no `url` yet, and it is in English, `en`: put each right in `statac.yaml`.

Eleventy reads a date written without an offset as UTC, so `timezone` is `UTC`: write the site's own, as `Europe/London`, where its dates were meant there.

The settings name no folder in a `dir` Statac can read, so Statac took Eleventy's own: `input` as `.`, `output` as `_site`, `includes` as `_includes` and `data` as `_data`.

The settings copy nothing as it is with an `addPassthroughCopy` Statac can read, so Statac copied only the files beside a page that its writing names.

The settings name no `markdownTemplateEngine`, so Statac read the template tags in the Markdown files as Liquid, as Eleventy does unless told otherwise.

The settings don't set `breaks: true`, so Statac read a line end inside a paragraph as a space, as Eleventy's Markdown does unless told otherwise.

The settings don't set `linkify: true`, so Eleventy left addresses written bare as words, and Statac links those starting `www.`, `http://` or `https://`, as https://statac.dev/writing/#addresses-written-bare describes.

The settings give Markdown no library of their own, so Statac took Eleventy's own, which publishes HTML in the writing as it is, as Statac does.

The settings name no plugin for attributes in braces, so Statac took `{.class}` and the like for words, as Eleventy did.

The settings name no `excerpt_separator`, so Statac changed no excerpt marker.

1 page had `permalink: false`, so Eleventy didn't publish it, and it came across with `draft: true`.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Old
language: en
timezone: UTC
date_format: 31 December 2025
date_short: 31 Dec 2025
date_day: 31 Dec
date_stamp: 31 Dec 2025, 15:04
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## Addresses

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 6 old addresses there: 6 are published there, or sent on from there.

- 6 pages carry a `permalink` of their own, where no pattern fits.

## Left for you

### Addresses Statac couldn't work out

Each of these pages has a `permalink` holding a template tag Statac can't work out, so its old address wasn't kept and the page is at Statac's own: give it a `permalink` of the address the old site published it at.

- `posts/post-6.md`, line 4: `{{ title | upcase }}`

### Addresses with no ending

Eleventy wrote each of these pages as a file of exactly that name, and Statac publishes a page whose address has no ending in a folder of that name, as `/about/` for `/about`: most hosts send a reader on from one to the other, but check that yours does.

- `posts/post-7.md`, line 4: `/post-7`

## Not converted

Nothing: Statac read every file of the old site.

## What to do next

1. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
2. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
3. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
