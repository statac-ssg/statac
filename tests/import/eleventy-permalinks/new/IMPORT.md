This site was imported from an Eleventy site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/eleventy-permalinks/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. It has no templates, so each page is published as its content alone until you add templates of your own: see https://statac.dev/templates/.

## What came across

- 7 posts, into `content/posts/`.
- 1 draft, with `draft: true`, so it isn't published by accident.

The old site's home page had no content of its own, so `content/index.md` has none: write the home page there.

Eleventy's settings are a program, and Statac runs none of it: it read `.eleventy.js` as text, for the plain forms it knows, and says here what it took and what it assumed where it found none.

Eleventy's settings hold no title, URL or language for the site, so the new site's `title` is made from the old folder's name, it has no `url` yet, and it is in English, `en`: put each right in `statac.yaml`.

Eleventy reads a date written without an offset as UTC, so `timezone` is `UTC`: write the site's own, as `Europe/London`, where its dates were meant there.

The settings name no folder in a `dir` Statac can read, so Statac took Eleventy's own: `input` as `.`, `output` as `_site`, `includes` as `_includes` and `data` as `_data`.

The settings copy nothing as it is with an `addPassthroughCopy` Statac can read, so Statac copied only the files beside a page that its content names.

The settings name no `markdownTemplateEngine`, so Statac read the template tags in the Markdown files as Liquid, as Eleventy does unless told otherwise.

The settings don't set `breaks: true`, so Statac read a line end inside a paragraph as a space, as Eleventy's Markdown does unless told otherwise.

The settings don't set `linkify: true`, so Eleventy left bare URLs as words, and Statac links those starting `www.`, `http://` or `https://`, as https://statac.dev/writing/#addresses-written-bare describes.

The settings give Markdown no library of their own, so Statac took Eleventy's own, which publishes HTML in Markdown as it is, as Statac does.

The settings name no plugin for attributes in braces, so Statac took `{.class}` and the like for words, as Eleventy did.

The settings name no `excerpt_separator`, so Statac changed no excerpt marker.

1 page had `permalink: false`, so Eleventy didn't publish it, and it came across with `draft: true`.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Old
language: en
timezone: UTC
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 6 old URLs there: 6 are published or redirected.

- 6 pages carry a `permalink` of their own, where no pattern fits.

## Left for you

### URLs Statac couldn't work out

Each of these pages has a `permalink` holding a template tag Statac can't work out, so its old URL wasn't kept and the page is at Statac's own: give it a `permalink` of the URL the old site published it at.

- `posts/post-6.md`, line 4: `{{ title | upcase }}`

### URLs with no ending

Eleventy wrote each of these pages as a file of exactly that name, and Statac publishes a page whose URL has no ending in a folder of that name, as `/about/` for `/about`: most hosts redirect from one to the other, but check that yours does.

- `posts/post-7.md`, line 4: `/post-7`

## Not converted

Nothing: Statac read every file of the old site.

## What to do next

1. Add your own templates to `templates/`.
2. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
3. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
4. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
