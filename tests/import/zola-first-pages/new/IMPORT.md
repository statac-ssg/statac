This site was imported from a Zola site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the writing, its settings and its addresses came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/zola-first-pages/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. The templates, snippets and stylesheet are Statac's starter, as `statac new` writes it: see https://statac.dev/new/.

## What came across

- 2 posts, into `content/posts/`.
- 1 page, into `content/` where it stood in the old site.

The old site had no home page of its own writing, so the starter's home page stays, listing the posts: `content/index.md`.

Zola has no setting for a time zone, and reads a date written without an offset as UTC, so `timezone` is `UTC`: write the site's own, as `Europe/London`, where its dates were meant there.

Zola's settings left straight quotes, `--` and `...` as typed, so `typography: false` keeps them so: take the line out to have Statac set them as print does.

Zola shows all of a list's pages on one page, unless the list's own page gives `paginate_by`, so `posts_per_page: 0` in `statac.yaml` does the same, and each list's page that gave it says `posts_per_page`; the first of its later pages, which Zola sent on to the list, is in the list's `redirect_from`.

The old site's home page showed its posts 1 to a page. Statac's home page shows the newest of each folder itself, so `content/index.md` keeps its own list to one page with `posts_per_page: 0`.

`content/posts/index.md` hands `pages.layout: post`, so the pages beneath it, every one dated, are built with the starter's template for posts.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: First pages
url: https://example.org
language: en
timezone: UTC
date_format: 31 December 2025
date_short: 31 Dec 2025
date_day: 31 Dec
date_stamp: 31 Dec 2025, 15:04
typography: false
posts_per_page: 0
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## Addresses

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 7 old addresses there: 7 are published there, or sent on from there.

- 2 pages carry `redirect_from`, for the other addresses that led to them.

## Left for you

Nothing: everything Statac read came across.

## Not converted

Nothing: Statac read every file of the old site.

## What to do next

1. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
2. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
3. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
