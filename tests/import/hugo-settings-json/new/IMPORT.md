This site was imported from a Hugo site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/hugo-settings-json/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. The templates, snippets and stylesheet are Statac's starter, as `statac new` writes it: see https://statac.dev/new/.

## What came across

- 1 post, into `content/posts/`.

The old site's home page had no content of its own, so the starter's home page stays, listing the posts: `content/index.md`.

Hugo's feeds were RSS, at `index.xml` beside the home page and each list page. Each is now an Atom feed at the same URL, written by `templates/feed.xml`, as `feed: index.xml` on each list page says, and `feed_ids_before` keeps each post's id the URL Hugo gave it, so feed readers see nothing new: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids. The feed Hugo made for each tag has no equal.

`content/posts/index.md` cascades `pages.layout: post`, so the pages beneath it, every one dated, are built with the starter's template for posts.

Hugo made a list of each folder at the top of the content folder, and these had no `_index.md` of their own, so Statac wrote one to keep what the list was given: `content/posts/index.md` for `content/posts/`.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Settings in JSON
url: https://example.org
language: fr
timezone: Europe/Paris
date_format: 31 décembre 2025
date_short: 31 déc. 2025
date_day: 31 déc.
date_stamp: 31 déc. 2025, 15:04
feed_ids_before: 2026-10-06
author: Name
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 4 old URLs there: 4 are published or redirected.

- Every page lands where the old site published it, with nothing added.

## Left for you

### Settings with no equal

Statac has no equal for each of these settings, so nothing came across for them: https://statac.dev/settings/ says what Statac offers.

- `hugo.json`, line 6: `googleAnalytics: G-0000000000`

## Not converted

Nothing: Statac read every file of the old site.

## What to do next

1. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
2. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
3. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
