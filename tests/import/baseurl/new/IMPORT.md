This site was imported from a Jekyll site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/baseurl/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. It has no templates, so each page is published as its content alone until you add templates of your own: see https://statac.dev/templates/.

## What came across

- 2 posts, into `content/posts/`.
- 2 pages, into `content/` where they stood in the old site.
- 1 other file, copied as it was: files published as they are into `static/` at the same path, so their URLs stay, and data files into `data/`.

No page of the old site's came across as its home page, so `content/index.md` is empty: write the home page there.

The settings name no language, so the site is in English, `en`: change `language` in `statac.yaml` if it isn't.

The settings name no time zone, so none is written, and Statac reads a date written without an offset as UTC, and says so: add `timezone` to `statac.yaml`, as `Europe/London`.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Under a path
url: https://example.org/blog
language: en
```

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 4 old URLs there: 4 are published or redirected.

- `content/posts/index.md` cascades `pages.permalink: /{year}/{month}/{day}/{slug}.html` to every page in `content/posts/`, which puts 2 of them at their old URLs.
- 2 pages carry a `permalink` of their own, where no pattern fits.
- The site is under a path, `/blog`, as its `url` says, so every URL starts with it, and links in the content were written with it: see https://statac.dev/urls/.

The old site's built output isn't in `_site/`, so no old URL was checked against the pages the old site built: build the old site and import again to check each one.

## Left for you

Nothing: everything Statac read came across.

## Not converted

Nothing: Statac read every file of the old site.

## What to do next

1. Add your own templates to `templates/`.
2. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
3. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
4. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
