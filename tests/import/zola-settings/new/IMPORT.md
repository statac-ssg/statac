This site was imported from a Zola site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/zola-settings/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. It has no templates, so each page is published as its content alone until you add templates of your own: see https://statac.dev/templates/.

## What came across

- 1 post, into `content/posts/`.
- 1 page, into `content/` where it stood in the old site.
- 1 other file, copied as it was: files published as they are into `static/` at the same path, so their URLs stay, and data files into `data/`.

The old site's home page had no content of its own, so `content/index.md` has none: write the home page there.

Zola has no setting for a time zone, and reads a date written without an offset as UTC, so `timezone` is `UTC`: write the site's own, as `Europe/London`, where its dates were meant there.

Zola's settings' `[markdown]` opened each link to another site with its own `target` or `rel`, so `snippets/markdown/link.html` writes each link the same.

Zola shows all of a list's pages on one page unless its list page gives `paginate_by`, and Statac does the same unless it gives `posts_per_page`.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Settings
url: https://example.org
language: en
timezone: UTC
description: A site whose settings come across.
author: Name
github: name
menu:
  - name: Posts
    url: /posts/
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 3 old URLs there: 3 are published or redirected.

- Every page lands where the old site published it, with nothing added.

## Left for you

### Settings with no equal

Statac has no equal for each of these settings, so nothing came across for them: https://statac.dev/settings/ says what Statac offers.

- `zola.toml`, line 5: `compile_sass: true`
- `zola.toml`, line 6: `build_search_index: true`
- `zola.toml`, line 9: `markdown.highlight_code: true`

## Not converted

Statac left these behind, and the new site has nothing of them:

- `sass/`: the old site's Sass stylesheets.
- `templates/`: the old site's templates.

## What to do next

1. Add your own templates to `templates/`.
2. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
3. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
4. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
