This site was imported from an Eleventy site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the writing, its settings and its addresses came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/eleventy-built-missing/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. The templates, snippets and stylesheet are Statac's starter, as `statac new` writes it: see https://statac.dev/new/.

## What came across

- 2 posts, into `content/posts/`.

The old site had no home page of its own writing, so the starter's home page stays, listing the posts: `content/index.md`.

Eleventy's settings are a program, and Statac runs none of it: it read `.eleventy.js` as text, for the plain forms it knows, and says here what it took and what it assumed where it found none.

Eleventy's settings hold no title, address or language for the site, so the new site's `title` is made from the old folder's name, it has no `url` yet, and it is in English, `en`: put each right in `statac.yaml`.

Eleventy reads a date written without an offset as UTC, so `timezone` is `UTC`: write the site's own, as `Europe/London`, where its dates were meant there.

The settings name no folder in a `dir` Statac can read, so Statac took Eleventy's own: `input` as `.`, `output` as `_site`, `includes` as `_includes` and `data` as `_data`.

The settings copy nothing as it is with an `addPassthroughCopy` Statac can read, so Statac copied only the files beside a page that its writing names.

The settings name no `markdownTemplateEngine`, so Statac read the template tags in the Markdown files as Liquid, as Eleventy does unless told otherwise.

The settings don't set `breaks: true`, so Statac read a line end inside a paragraph as a space, as Eleventy's Markdown does unless told otherwise.

The settings don't set `linkify: true`, so Eleventy left addresses written bare as words, and Statac links those starting `www.`, `http://` or `https://`, as https://statac.dev/writing/#addresses-written-bare describes.

The settings give Markdown no library of their own, so Statac took Eleventy's own, which publishes HTML in the writing as it is, as Statac does.

The settings name no plugin for attributes in braces, so Statac took `{.class}` and the like for words, as Eleventy did.

The settings name no `excerpt_separator`, so Statac changed no excerpt marker.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Old
language: en
timezone: UTC
date_format: 31 December 2025
date_short: 31 Dec 2025
date_day: 31 Dec
date_stamp: 31 Dec 2025, 15:04
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## Addresses

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 2 old addresses there: 2 are published there, or sent on from there.

- Every page lands where the old site published it, with nothing added.

Each address was also looked for in the old site's own built output, `_site/`.

The old site's built output also holds 1 page at an address Statac didn't work out, and nothing in the new site answers it. Give the page that should answer it a `redirect_from` naming it:

- `/old-page/`: 1 page, `/old-page/`

## Left for you

### Addresses the old built site doesn't have

Statac worked these addresses out by the old tool's rules, but the old site's built output has nothing there, so the rule was wrong for the page or the output is older than the writing: find where the old site published the page, and add that address to the page's `redirect_from`.

- `posts/post-1.md`: `/posts/post-1/`

## Not converted

Statac left these behind, and the new site has nothing of them:

- `_site/`: the old site's built output, read only to check the addresses.

## What to do next

1. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
2. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
3. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
