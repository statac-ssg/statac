This site was imported from a Hugo site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/hugo-under-path/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. It has no templates, so Statac publishes each page as its content alone until you add templates of your own: see https://statac.dev/templates/. Adding `templates/index.xml` builds its feeds.

## What came across

- 2 posts, into `content/posts/`.
- 1 page, into `content/` where it stood in the old site.
- 2 other files, copied unchanged: the files to publish into `static/` at the same path, so their URLs stay, and data files into `data/`.

No page of the old site's came across as its home page, so `content/index.md` has no content: write the home page there.

Hugo's feeds were RSS, at `index.xml` beside the home page and each list page. Each stays at the same URL, as `feed: index.xml` on each list page says, built with `templates/index.xml` once you add it, and `feed_ids_before` and `feed_ids_from: hugo` keep each post's id the URL Hugo gave it, so feed readers see nothing new: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids. Copy the docs' RSS template as `templates/index.xml`: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#the-template.

Hugo made a list of each folder at the top of the content folder, and these had no `_index.md` of their own, so Statac wrote one to keep what the list was given: `content/posts/index.md` for `content/posts/`.

Hugo summed up 1 page with its opening paragraphs, as many as made its `summaryLength` of words, and Statac takes the first paragraph alone: where a summary should run further, put `<!--more-->` on a line of its own where it should end.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Under a path
url: https://example.org/blog
language: en
timezone: UTC
feed_ids_before: 2026-10-06
feed_ids_from: hugo
posts_per_page: 10
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 6 old URLs there: 6 are published or redirected.

- The site is under a path, `/blog`, as its `url` says, so every URL starts with it, and links in the content were written with it: see https://statac.dev/urls/.

Each URL was also looked for in the old site's own built output, `public/`.

## Left for you

### Links to pages that didn't come across

Each of these names a page Statac couldn't find in the old site, so the import left it unchanged: link to the page's URL instead.

- `content/posts/post-1.md`, line 11: `{{< ref "post-9.md" >}}`

### Shortcodes now snippet calls

Each of these shortcodes is now a call to a snippet of its name, and the snippet holds only a comment saying it wasn't converted: write the snippet, as https://statac.dev/snippets/ describes, or take the calls out.

- `snippets/figure.html`:
  - `content/posts/post-1.md`, line 17: `{{< figure src="/blog/images/photo-1.jpg" alt="A picture named with the path the site is under" >}}`

### URLs the old built site doesn't have

Statac worked these URLs out by the old tool's rules, but the old site's built output has nothing there, so the rule was wrong for the page or the output is older than the content: find where the old site published the page, and add that URL to the page's `redirect_from`.

- `content/posts/post-2.md`: `/posts/post-2/`

## Not converted

Statac left these behind, and the new site has nothing of them:

- `public/`: the old site's built output, read only to check the URLs.

## What to do next

1. Add your own templates to `templates/`.
2. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
3. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
4. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
