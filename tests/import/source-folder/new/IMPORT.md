This site was imported from a Jekyll site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/source-folder/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. The templates, snippets and stylesheet are Statac's starter, as `statac new` writes it: see https://statac.dev/new/.

## What came across

- 1 post, into `content/posts/`.
- 2 pages, into `content/` where they stood in the old site.
- 1 other file, copied as it was: files published as they are into `static/` at the same path, so their URLs stay, and data files into `data/`.

The old site's home page had no content of its own, so the starter's home page stays, listing the posts: `content/index.md`.

The settings name no language, so the site is in English, `en`: change `language` in `statac.yaml` if it isn't.

The settings name no time zone, so none is written, and Statac reads a date written without an offset as UTC, and says so: add `timezone` to `statac.yaml`, as `Europe/London`.

The settings' `source` is `site/`, so the site was read from there, and nothing else in the old folder is the site's.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Source
language: en
date_format: 31 December 2025
date_short: 31 Dec 2025
date_day: 31 Dec
date_stamp: 31 Dec 2025, 15:04
tags.pages: true
series.pages: true
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 3 old URLs there: 3 are published or redirected.

- 3 pages carry a `permalink` of their own, where no pattern fits.

Each URL was also looked for in the old site's own built output, `built/`.

## Left for you

Nothing: everything Statac read came across.

## Not converted

Statac left these behind, and the new site has nothing of them:

- `site/_layouts/`: the old site's layouts, which the starter's templates take the place of.

## What to do next

1. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
2. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
3. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
