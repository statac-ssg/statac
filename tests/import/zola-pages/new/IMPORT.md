This site was imported from a Zola site, as well as Statac can. It is a best effort: the content, its settings and its URLs came across, the old site's templates and theme did not, and what is listed below needs your eye before you publish.

It was made from `tests/import/zola-pages/old` by `statac import`, which changed nothing there. The templates, snippets and stylesheet are Statac's starter, as `statac new` writes it: see https://statac.dev/new/.

## What came across

- 7 posts, into `content/posts/`.
- 2 pages, into `content/` where they stood in the old site.
- 1 other file, copied as it was: files published as they are into `static/` at the same path, so their URLs stay, and data files into `data/`.

The old site's home page had no content of its own, so the starter's home page stays, listing the posts: `content/index.md`.

Zola has no setting for a time zone, and reads a date written without an offset as UTC, so `timezone` is `UTC`: write the site's own, as `Europe/London`, where its dates were meant there.

Zola shows all of a list's pages on one page unless its list page gives `paginate_by`, and Statac does the same unless it gives `posts_per_page`.

`content/posts/index.md` cascades `pages.layout: post`, so the pages beneath it, every one dated, are built with the starter's template for posts.

The settings written in `statac.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Pages
url: https://example.org
language: en
timezone: UTC
date_format: 31 December 2025
date_short: 31 Dec 2025
date_day: 31 Dec
date_stamp: 31 Dec 2025, 15:04
tags.pages: true
series.pages: true
```

and a `feed_key` made fresh for the site: see https://statac.dev/feeds/#entry-ids.

## URLs

Statac worked out where the old site published each page, read the new site, and looked for each of the 12 old URLs there: 12 are published or redirected.

- 2 pages carry a `permalink` of their own, where no pattern fits.
- 2 pages carry `redirect_from`, for the other URLs that led to them.

1 image beside a page is shown as resized copies Statac makes, and the file itself isn't published, so its old URL, `/posts/post-1/photo-1.jpg`, is no longer published. An image's own file is published where a page links to it, or where its sidecar file, such as `photo-1.jpg.yaml`, holds `optimise: false`; `optimise_images: false` in `statac.yaml` leaves every image as it is: see https://statac.dev/pictures/.

## Left for you

Nothing: everything Statac read came across.

## Not converted

Statac left these behind, and the new site has nothing of them:

- `content/posts/data.xlsx`: a file the settings' `ignored_content` names, which Zola doesn't read.

## What to do next

1. Run `statac check` in this folder, and put right what it shows.
2. Run `statac serve`, and read the site in a browser beside the old one.
3. Once nothing here is left to do, delete `IMPORT.md`.
